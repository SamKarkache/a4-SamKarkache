## WPI School Work Tracker using React.js
For Assignment 4 I chose to implement the web-application that I created for A2/A3 to use
React.js with Vite for the front-end. The front-end functionality is now specified
in the `App.jsx` file in the `src` directory. The school work tracker uses MongoDB
to save assignments with the Node.js backend sending the information to React. Overall, 
React made the development process much easier for the front-end. There was a slight learning
curve initially since I had to learn Reacts syntax and features. However, once I learned what I 
could do with React, functionality such as `useEffect()` and `useState()` helped tremendously.
